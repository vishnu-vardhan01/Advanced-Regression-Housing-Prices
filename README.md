## General Information

- Problem Statement - Model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
- Various data analysis and regression steps were followed and charts were plotted to reach some conclusions and recommendations for house price predictions

## Conclusions
- 3 models were built, and Lasso model was found as best predictor based on test R2 score
- Top feature identified to predict house sale price

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Matplotlib Library
- Pandas Library
- Seaborn Library
